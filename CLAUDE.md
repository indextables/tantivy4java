Tantivy4Java
--------------
- A complete port of the python tantivy language bindings targeting java instead of python.
- Access the python bindings here: file:/Users/schenksj/tmp/x/tantivy-py
- Implements test cases with the same coverage
- Uses JNI with direct memory sharing for maximum speed and minimum memory use
- Zero copy and marshalling between rust and java wherever possible
- Targets Java 11 and above
- Uses maven for builds
- Creates a jar library that includes all native build components
- Uses the package com.tantivy4java

## ‚úÖ RECENTLY RESOLVED ISSUES

### Document Retrieval Pipeline (COMPLETED)
- **Problem**: Document retrieval infrastructure needed implementation  
- **Solution**: Complete `Searcher.doc(DocAddress)` implementation following Python model
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FULLY WORKING - End-to-end document retrieval with field extraction
- **Verification**: Python compatibility test passes with exact behavioral match

### Hit Object Access (RESOLVED)
- **Previous Issue**: getHits() method JNI implementation

- **Status**: Working search results with scores and DocAddress
- **Impact**: Complete search pipeline now functional

## üéØ COMPREHENSIVE FIELD TYPE SUPPORT ‚úÖ

**ALL MAJOR FIELD TYPES IMPLEMENTED**
- **Text Fields**: Full tokenization and indexing support
- **Numeric Fields**: Integer (i64), Float (f64), Unsigned (u64) with fast fields
- **Boolean Fields**: True/false values with proper indexing and storage
- **Date Fields**: Java LocalDateTime support with timezone handling  
- **IP Address Fields**: IPv4 and IPv6 support with automatic conversion
- **All fields support**: Storage, indexing, fast field access options

## üéØ MINOR REMAINING FUTURE WORK

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
