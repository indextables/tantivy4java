# Turn the review job's result into a verdict: validate the reviewer's
# structured output, write the comment body, append the job summary, and set
# the step outputs `verdict` (pass|fail|none) and `reason`.
#
# Fails closed: anything other than a schema-valid output from a review job
# that succeeded yields `none`, never `pass`. This script does not itself fail
# on a missing or bad verdict; the workflow's last step makes the job
# conclusion follow the `verdict` output.
#
# Reviewer output is untrusted. It is only ever parsed by jq and written to
# files through render.jq; it is never echoed to the log, never written to
# GITHUB_OUTPUT and never expanded by the shell.
#
# Required environment:
#   REVIEW_RESULT      result of the review job (success|failure|cancelled|skipped)
#   PRECHECK_REASON    `reason` output of fetch-diff.sh ("ok" when a review ran)
#   STRUCTURED_OUTPUT  raw structured output of the review step (may be empty)
#   PR_NUMBER, HEAD_SHA
#   OUT_DIR            where comment.md is written
#   GITHUB_OUTPUT, GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
#   GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_RUN_ID   (set by the runner)
# Optional:
#   OPENED_BY_DEPENDABOT  "true" adds the fixed note on dependency updates
#   COMMENT_MAX_CHARS     cap for the comment body (GitHub rejects > 65536)
